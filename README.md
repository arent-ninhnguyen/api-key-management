# API Key Management Dashboard

A dashboard for managing API keys with Supabase integration.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete API keys
- Set usage limits for individual keys
- Track API key usage
- Secure key storage with Supabase

## Project Specification

### Overview
This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing API keys with advanced features for tracking usage, setting limits, and secure validation. It's built with a modern frontend architecture using Next.js and integrates with Supabase for backend functionality.

### Core Components

#### 1. Dashboard
- **API Key Statistics**: Displays total keys, active keys, and API usage metrics
- **API Key Table**: Lists all keys with details including name, status, usage, and creation date
- **Usage Visualization**: Shows current usage compared to limits with appropriate warning indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports

#### 2. API Key Management
- **Create Modal**: Form to create new API keys with name and optional usage limits
- **Edit Modal**: Update existing keys, modify names and usage limits
- **Delete Confirmation**: Safe deletion with confirmation dialog
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copy to clipboard with feedback

#### 3. API Key Validation
- **Playground Interface**: Test environment for validating API keys
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on key validity
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid keys
- **Usage Tracking**: Increments usage count when keys are validated

#### 4. Security Features
- **Secure Storage**: Keys stored securely in Supabase with encryption
- **Usage Limits**: Prevent abuse by setting and enforcing usage caps
- **User-specific Keys**: Each user can only access their own API keys
- **Validation Safeguards**: Rate limiting and protection against brute-force attempts

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend
- **React Components**: Modular design with reusable components
- **State Management**: Context API for application state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- **Forms**: Validation with client-side error handling
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states

#### Backend Integration
- **Supabase API**: REST endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Authentication**: User-specific data access with row-level security
- **Data Structure**: Optimized schema for API key management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages

#### Testing
- **Cypress Tests**: End-to-end testing for all key functionality
- **Test Coverage**: Dashboard views, API key operations, and playground validation
- **Mock Data**: Simulated API responses for consistent testing
- **Edge Cases**: Testing for limit conditions, errors, and validation scenarios

### User Workflows

1. **Creating an API Key**:
   - User navigates to dashboard
   - Clicks "Create API Key" button
   - Enters key name and optional usage limit
   - Receives generated API key with option to copy

2. **Validating an API Key**:
   - User navigates to playground
   - Enters API key in validation field
   - Submits for validation
   - Receives success confirmation or error message

3. **Managing Usage Limits**:
   - User monitors key usage through dashboard
   - Receives warnings when approaching limits
   - Can edit keys to adjust limits as needed
   - Dashboard shows exceeded limits with visual indicators

4. **Deleting an API Key**:
   - User selects key to delete
   - Confirms deletion intent
   - Receives confirmation of successful deletion
   - Dashboard updates to reflect changes

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new table called `api_keys` with the following schema:

```sql
create table api_keys (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  key text not null unique,
  usage integer default 0,
  status text default 'Active',
  usage_limit boolean default false,
  limit_value integer,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id)
);

-- Create policies for RLS (Row Level Security)
alter table api_keys enable row level security;

-- Policy to only allow users to see their own API keys
create policy "Users can view their own API keys" 
  on api_keys for select 
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy to only allow users to insert their own API keys
create policy "Users can insert their own API keys" 
  on api_keys for insert 
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy to only allow users to update their own API keys
create policy "Users can update their own API keys" 
  on api_keys for update 
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy to only allow users to delete their own API keys
create policy "Users can delete their own API keys" 
  on api_keys for delete 
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

3. Get your Supabase URL and anon key from the project settings

### 2. Environment Variables

1. Copy the `.env.local` file and update with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Authentication

To implement user authentication with Supabase:

1. Enable authentication providers in your Supabase project
2. Implement sign-in/sign-up flows using Supabase Auth
3. Update the API key functions to include the user_id in queries

## Technology Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

    - dashboard.cy.js   - Tests for dashboard functionality
    - overview.cy.js    - Tests for overview page statistics and navigation
    - playground.cy.js  - Tests for API key validation
  /fixtures         - Mock data used in tests
  /support          - Test helpers and custom commands
  /screenshots      - Saved automatically when tests fail

   - Tests URL maintenance on validation failure
   - Validates dashboard link display when API limit exceeded

### Mock Data and API Interception

The tests use several techniques to simulate API interactions:

- **Custom Commands**: Reusable commands in `cypress/support/commands.js` provide consistent API mocking:
  ```javascript
  // Example: Mock API keys data
  cy.mockApiKeys();
  ```

- **API Interception**: Cypress intercept patterns target the specific endpoints used by the application:
  ```javascript
  cy.intercept('GET', '**/rest/v1/api_keys**', {
    statusCode: 200,
    fixture: 'apiKeys.json'
  }).as('getApiKeys');
  ```

- **Fixtures**: JSON files in `cypress/fixtures/` provide consistent test data
- **Authentication**: The `cy.setAuth()` command sets up localStorage tokens for authenticated requests

### Best Practices

When writing tests for this application, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use custom commands** from `commands.js` for consistent API mocking
2. **Set authentication** with `cy.setAuth()` at the beginning of tests
3. **Be flexible with selectors** to handle UI changes gracefully
4. **Verify functionality, not implementation** to create more resilient tests
5. **Test responsive design** across multiple device sizes
6. **Mock API responses** to ensure consistent test data

```

Key features of this workflow:
- Runs tests on Chrome browser for consistent results
- Reduces log output for cleaner CI runs (`quiet: true`)
- Increases default command timeout to 10 seconds for reliability
- Only uploads screenshots, videos, and logs when tests fail
- Uses npm caching to speed up dependency installation
